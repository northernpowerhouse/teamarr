Provides reverse-lookup for:
1. Event matching: "Freiburg vs Stuttgart" → candidate leagues
2. Team multi-league: Liverpool → [eng.1, uefa.champions, eng.fa, ...]
3. League discovery: all soccer leagues for "soccer_all"

Caches data from all registered providers (ESPN, TSDB, etc.).
Refresh weekly to handle promotion/relegation.
